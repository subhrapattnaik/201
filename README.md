tkinter
Tkinter provides us with a variety of common GUI
elements which we can use to build our interface.
Some of the few common widgets available are:
● Button: When clicked, an operation can be triggered
● Label: to display something on-screen
● Entry: to get a single line user input
● List box: provides a list of options
● Label frame: Used for results to display in a frame.
And there are many more available as per application
design
